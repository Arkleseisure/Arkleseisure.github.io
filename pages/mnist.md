# MNIST Neural Networks  
## The MNIST dataset 
As we noted on the XOR page, failure on the XOR dataset killed machine learning research off for a while after Minsky and Papert's infamous book was published in 1969. Success on MNIST in 1998 however, kicked the field of machine learning off properly (although there had been another explosion of research and a 2nd ai winter in between).

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, all in greyscale. They look something like this:
