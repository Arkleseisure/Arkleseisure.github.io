This is a project for the BlueDot Alignment course attempting to automate interpretability by fully explaining neural networks using ChatGPT.
This is attempted on 2 problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.

It is recommended that the reader first reads the section about the XOR problem, which is simpler and introduces concepts used for the MNIST dataset.
