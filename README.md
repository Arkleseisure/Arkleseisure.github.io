This is a project for the BlueDot Alignment course attempting to automate interpretability by fully explaining neural networks using ChatGPT.
This is attempted on 2 problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.

**XOR Neural Networks**
The XOR (exclusive or) problem is defined as follows:
2 binary inputs
1 output

0 xor 0 = 0
0 xor 1 = 1
1 xor 0 = 1
1 xor 1 = 0
