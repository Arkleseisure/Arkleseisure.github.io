This is a project for the BlueDot Alignment course attempting to automate interpretability by fully explaining neural networks using ChatGPT.
This is attempted on 2 problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.

This is fully explained on the website, https://arkleseisure.github.io/. However, this repo also contains the 3 python files used for the project.
