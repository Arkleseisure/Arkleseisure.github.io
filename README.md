This is a project for the BlueDot Alignment course attempting to automate interpretability by fully explaining neural networks using ChatGPT.
This is attempted on 2 problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.

**XOR Neural Networks**
The XOR (exclusive or) problem is defined as follows:\n
2 binary inputs\n
1 output\n

0 xor 0 = 0\n
0 xor 1 = 1\n
1 xor 0 = 1\n
1 xor 1 = 0\n
