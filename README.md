NOTE: THIS WEBSITE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. NAVIGATE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a project for the BlueDot Alignment course attempting to automate interpretability by fully explaining neural networks using ChatGPT.
This is attempted on 2 problems: the XOR problem and the MNIST dataset.

This is fully explained on the website, https://arkleseisure.github.io/pages. However, this repo also contains the 3 python files used for the project, found in the 'project_code' folder.
These can be downloaded and run as normal python files, with interp_lib.py an import for the other 2. An OpenAI API key is needed as I'm not willing to pay for everyone's chatgpt access.
